        <p>Chastise is an interesting ability, but I doubt you will find much use for it in PVE.
        In PVP this is a pretty decent ability. A two second root can make or break an arena match for you.</p>

        <p>Gemcutting is a fairly weak passive.
        As a shadow priest you will most likely want to be Tailoring/Enchanting.
        Jewelcrafting is a fairly weak profession as a shadow priest pushing their PVE potential.</p>

        <p>Gift of the Naaru is probably the weakest link of all of the draenei racials.
        It's a very minimal heal over time effect at level 70 at least.
        I do think it's better than most people think though at least for leveling.
        Unfortunately it doesn't scale very well with levels or spellpower.
        I did find myself using this and throwing a max rank renew before taking on more difficult mobs solo.</p>

        <p>In terms of PVE the alliance have a massive advantage; the draenei.
            Bringing their 1% spell hit into the equation, this means you can gear even less for spell hit.
            Inspiring presence is by far and away the best racial for shadow priests
            (alot of raids will even form their groups around your hit chance group passive).</p>

        <p>This is a surpisingly helpful passive resistance.
        There is ALOT of shadow damage in The Burning Crusade.
        Obviously 10 shadow resistance isn't much,
        but all classes get one and for BC I would definitely consider this the best.</p>

        <p>Ah, one of my favorite cooldowns.
        Symbol of Hope is incredible, the scaling works very well in terms of leveling.
        This will be a very powerful cooldown for you and your group members.
        You will truly embrace the mana-battery mentality with this.</p>
