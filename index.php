    <p>This is our shadowy lair. We will be journeying into the dark portal soon enough, and lucky for you Blizzard has blessed us into viability. I plan on playing a Draenei Shadow Priest in The Burning Crusade Classic, and I can't wait for the prepatch to hit live servers. This website is dedicated to all lovers of the world of shadows (no warlocks allowed, sorry). Join me as I attempt to create the best encapsulation of all things Shadow Priest to help your journey into The Burning Crusade Classic.
