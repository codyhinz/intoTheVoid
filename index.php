        <p>This is our shadowy lair, and soon we will be journeying into the dark portal again. Lucky for you Blizzard has blessed us into viability. I plan on playing a Draenei Shadow Priest in The Burning Crusade Classic, and I can't wait for the prepatch to hit live servers. This website is dedicated to all lovers of the world of shadows (no warlocks allowed, sorry). Join me as I attempt to create the best encapsulation of all things Shadow Priest to help your journey into The Burning Crusade Classic.

        <p>Fair enough, I am a long time private server enjoyer with many Sunwell Plateau clears on various servers(most of which as a shadow priest). I don't claim to be the best at anything, but I have done this progression about a dozen times and I'm here to share some wisdom. My only trackable achievements are my parses in classic. I have a rank 1 parse as a fury warrior on classic, and I hope to be the rank 1 Alliance shadow priest in Classic TBC.
