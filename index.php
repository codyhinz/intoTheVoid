        <p>This is our shadowy lair, and soon we will be journeying into the dark portal again.
        Lucky for you Blizzard has blessed us into viability.
        I plan on playing a Draenei Shadow Priest in The Burning Crusade Classic,
        and I can't wait for the prepatch to hit live servers.
        This website is dedicated to all lovers of the world of shadows (no warlocks allowed, sorry). 
        Join me as I attempt to create the best encapsulation of all things Shadow Priest to help your journey into The Burning Crusade Classic.

                <p>I am a long time private server enjoyer with tons of experience on various servers(Atlantiss, Windrunner, Sunstrider, etc).
                I don't claim to be the best at anything, but I have done this progression about a dozen times.
                My only trackable achievements are my parses in classic.
                I have a rank 1 parse as a fury warrior on classic, and I hope to be the 
                <span class="font-weight-bold">Rank 1 Shadow Priest</span> in Classic TBC.</p>

        <p>Have you ever attempted to find TBC specific information? It is an absolute nightmare, and super inconsistent.
        I'm not exactly sure why this is the case(probably because at best we have private server guesses),
        but from 2.0-2.4.3 is very difficult to get solid information. 
        This website will specifically focus on everything I can 100% confirm, 
        and if it's not 100% confirmed their will be at least solid sources.</p>
